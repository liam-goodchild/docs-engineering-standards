# Engineering Standards

## Purpose

This repository defines the engineering standards for infrastructure, pipelines, and repository management. The goal is to provide a single source of truth for consistent practices across all projects.

This standard:

- Establishes consistent patterns for repository setup and naming
- Documents Terraform state management and security configurations
- Provides readme templates for clear, maintainable documentation
